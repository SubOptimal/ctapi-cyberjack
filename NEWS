===========================================================================
                  ctapi-cyberjack-3.0.1 (2007/07/10)
===========================================================================

This is a hotfix for the USB suspend problem with Kernel 2.6.20:
It seems like libusb does not detect the cyberjack 0x400 correctly when
the reader is suspended (e.g. libusb only detects the reader when it
currently is not suspended, but the reader needs some time to become
active after resuming and Libusb does not wait for this time...
Now we just try for about 5 secs to enumerate the USB devices via libusb
which keeps the reader active until it has completed its initialization).
This fix is only needed as long as Libusb has these problems, maybe they
will fix this...


===========================================================================
                  ctapi-cyberjack-3.0.0 (2007/06/21)

overcome them.
