===========================================================================



===========================================================================
MARK: released ctapi-cyberjack-3.3.0beta4 (2008/07/03)
===========================================================================


2008/07/03: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
------------------------------------------------
- IFD: accept WIN32 code for GET_FEATURE (now works with rdesktop)
- IFD: fixed a problem with VERIFY_PIN


===========================================================================
MARK: released ctapi-cyberjack-3.3.0beta3 (2008/06/11)
===========================================================================

Fixed a problem in implementation of FEATURE_MCT_READER_DIRECT.


===========================================================================
MARK: released ctapi-cyberjack-3.3.0beta2 (2008/06/07)
===========================================================================


2008/06/04: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
------------------------------------------------
- recent releases of pcsclite use libhal to detect readers. Therefore
  they changed the default namespace for the reader names (from "libusb:"
  to "libhal:") which also has a new syntax. Therefore we are forced to
  support libhal as well.


===========================================================================
MARK: released ctapi-cyberjack-3.3.0beta1 (2008/06/02)
===========================================================================


2008/05/31: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
------------------------------------------------
- implemented FEATURE_MCT_READERDIRECT


2008/05/27: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
------------------------------------------------
- fixed two typos in ifd/part10.c
- added missing newline to ECFReader.h
- copied Reader.h from svn/include to drivers include dir (we definately
  should have the version within the driver be the only one!)
- added BingoError.h from the include/firmware folder (sigh)
- fixed a bug in ctapi.cpp (was using a false DEBUG_MASK for CTAPI)
- improved error logging in ctapi.cpp
- ifd/part10.c: Now check the endianess of ulDataLength in verify/modify pin
  structures
- added ID 0x401 to list of recognized USB readers in USBLinux.cpp


===========================================================================
MARK: released ctapi-cyberjack-3.2.0 (2008/04/03)
===========================================================================


2008/04/03: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
------------------------------------------------
- pulled-in changes from the Windows driver


2008/03/25: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
------------------------------------------------
- fixed a bug in usbdev with old versions of sysfs (like on SuSE10.0)


2008/02/12: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
------------------------------------------------
- LIESMICH.xml: added section about Moneyplex on 64-bit systems


===========================================================================
MARK: released ctapi-cyberjack-3.2.0beta2 (2008/02/12)
===========================================================================


2008/02/12: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
------------------------------------------------
- cjIoOpen_libusb(): 
  - only try to detach kernel driver if claim_interface() doesn't work
  - don't set configuration (is done by the kernel anyway)
  - call ausb_reset() like driver 2.0.14 did if the corresponding flag is
    set in the configuration file
  - added some more debug messages
- LIESMICH.xml: added description of flag RESET_BEFORE


===========================================================================
MARK: released ctapi-cyberjack-3.2.0beta1 (2008/02/08)
===========================================================================



2008/02/08: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
------------------------------------------------
- updated LIESMICH.xml: it now contains a section about the tool
  "cyberjack", some other sections have been updated


2008/02/06: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
------------------------------------------------
- ausb{1,3}.c: added timeout control to avoid infinite loops
- ctapi.cpp: function _init_common1() now also checks for kernel mode
  when device name is given (not only for port values). Now works with
  libchipcard.


2008/02/05: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
------------------------------------------------
- make libsysfs mandatory (we now depend on it)
- added member "port" to struct rsct_usbdev_t
- reenabled access via kernel module for 0x100 devices
- enabled logging even when using kernel module for 0x100 devices
- serial devices and /dev/ttyUSBx access is now availabe via
  rsct_init_name()
- renamed config_*() functions to rsct_config_*() and export those functions
- tool cyberjack: 
  - added commands:
    - check: this is the default when missing, it performs the checks like
             before
    - addflags: adds flags in the configuration file
    - delflags: clears flags in the configuration file
    The latter two functions have been introduced to simplify setting/clearing
    of flags (these commands always find the correct configuration file).
  - don't bail out if the device file in /proc/bus/usb is not accessible


===========================================================================
MARK: released ctapi-cyberjack-3.1.0 (2008/01/10)
===========================================================================


===========================================================================
MARK: released ctapi-cyberjack-3.0.6rc4 (2007/12/12)
===========================================================================


===========================================================================
MARK: released ctapi-cyberjack-3.0.6rc3 (2007/12/12)
===========================================================================


2007/12/12: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
------------------------------------------------
- ausb.c: changed ausb_init() to call usb_init() only once but
  usb_find_busses() and usb_find_devices() at every call


2007/12/10: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
------------------------------------------------
- added support for readers connected via serial ports
- added section about this new feature to LIESMICH.xml
- fixed "cyberjack" tool module cm_reader (now creates a correct
  xml file).


===========================================================================
MARK: released ctapi-cyberjack-3.0.6rc2 (2007/12/03)
===========================================================================


2007/11/29: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
------------------------------------------------
- fixed a bug in ecom_a code concerning APDU 20,10


===========================================================================
MARK: released ctapi-cyberjack-3.0.6rc1 (2007/11/19)
===========================================================================


2007/11/17: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
------------------------------------------------
- added code which enumerates readers using libsysfs
- added special handling for CT_init() with port values of 0x9000: Now a
  configuration file is used to assign fixed port numbers to readers using
  their serial numbers.
  However, this doesn't work with ancient Cyberjacks (e.g. product id 0x100).
- added documentation about this new feature to LIESMICH.xml


2007/11/16: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
------------------------------------------------
- hopefully fixed communication problems with 0x100 and 0x400
- included a patch from Bernd Kupfer (adds ausb_reset_pipe())


2007/11/13: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
------------------------------------------------
- removed call to ausb_reset() for 0x400 (this led to problems)


2007/11/06: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
------------------------------------------------
- fixed modifications to tool cjflash
- no longer try to set configuration for 0x400 (we just use the only 
  available configuration)
- now also detach kernel module "cyberjack" from 0x400 when claiming the
  interface fails (for some odd reasons at least my kernel loads that module
  for the reader)


2007/11/02: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
------------------------------------------------
- added environment variable "CJ_SLEEP_MS2" which inserts a waiting
  time (in milliseconds) directly after calling ausb_open()


2007/10/30: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
------------------------------------------------
- added environment variable "CJ_SLEEP_MS1" which inserts a waiting
  time (in milliseconds) directly before calling ausb_open()


2007/10/25: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
------------------------------------------------
- applied a patch provided by Daniel Golle which adapts our use of
  variadic macros so that newer versions of GCC work, too
- tried a new solution in fixing the problem with new kernels and old
  readers


===========================================================================
MARK: released ctapi-cyberjack-3.0.5rc1 (2007/10/18)
===========================================================================


2007/10/18: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
------------------------------------------------
- fixed some warnings about missing parentheses and deprecated pragmas
- CCIDReader.cpp: Fixed a bug in _CtData() about command 20/12 
  (REQUEST_ICC). For this command actually Le may be omitted and still
  means 0 (as opposed to "no data expected"). Without this fix Moneyplex
  is unable to request a card.


===========================================================================
MARK: released ctapi-cyberjack-3.0.5beta5 (2007/10/08)
===========================================================================


2007/10/05: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
------------------------------------------------
- changed some char* arguments to "const char*" because automatic conversion
  from string constant to "const char*" is deprecated in recent versions of
  gcc
- copied eca_defines.h from other SVN folder to the driver where it is also 
  needed (the driver tree should be self-sufficient)


2007/10/01: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
------------------------------------------------
- log file is automatically truncated upon CT_init() if its size exceeds a 
  given limit (currenty 10 MB)


2007/09/21: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
------------------------------------------------
- tool cyberjack: added check for ancient kernels


===========================================================================
MARK: released ctapi-cyberjack-3.0.5beta1 (2007/09/19)
===========================================================================


2007/09/19: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
------------------------------------------------
- call ausb_reset() prior to ausb_close() to workaround hanging reader


===========================================================================
MARK: released ctapi-cyberjack-3.0.4 (2007/09/16)
===========================================================================


2007/09/16: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
------------------------------------------------
- cyberjack (diagnosis tool):
  added a check for CT_data() which reads firmware information (makes it
  easier for the Linux support)


===========================================================================
MARK: released ctapi-cyberjack-3.0.4beta1 (2007/08/16)
===========================================================================


2007/08/16: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
------------------------------------------------
- fixed a bug in Debug.cpp (was mangling with the stack given special 
  circumstances)


2007/07/27: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
------------------------------------------------
- removed debug-setting of debug level mask (was set to all-on)


===========================================================================
MARK: released ctapi-cyberjack-3.0.3 (2007/07/20)
===========================================================================


2007/07/18: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
------------------------------------------------
- fixed a bug regarding Ecom (0x100) readers


2007/07/17: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
------------------------------------------------
- improved AUSB logging (should give more information): Now all drivers are
  able to provide USB logging
- more debugging of ecom code


2007/07/16: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
------------------------------------------------
- fixed a bug with APDU responses which exceed 262 bytes with old Ecom's


===========================================================================
MARK: released ctapi-cyberjack-3.0.2 (2007/07/16)
===========================================================================


2007/07/16: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
------------------------------------------------
- some major memory checking with valgrind:
  - fixed some possible memory leaks (e.g. by using correct delete 
    notations, adding some delete's where missing etc)
- CT_init() now internally reads vendor specific information (e.g.
  firmware version etc) to make the log files more usefull
- if "$SYSCONFDIR/cyberjack.conf" does not exist try to load
  "$SYSCONFDIR/cyberjack.conf.default" which is installed by default
  on any system (simplifies support)
- Debian packages no longer remove the group "cyberjack"
- "getenv()" in USBLinux.cpp has big issues with the driver: When it is
  used the driver crashes, when commented-out the driver works. Since I
  don't need it here anyway (since there are no Ecom(a) with firmware
  prior to 3.0.6) I just commented it out completely


2007/07/12: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
------------------------------------------------
- found correct place for call to usb_reset(), now opening and closing the
  new Cyberjack many times in a row now works


2007/07/11: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
------------------------------------------------
- fixed return type in tool cjgeldkarte


===========================================================================
MARK: released ctapi-cyberjack-3.0.1 (2007/07/10)
===========================================================================


2007/07/10: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
------------------------------------------------
- introduced a hotfix for the USB suspend problem with Kernel 2.6.20:
  It seems like libusb does not detect the cyberjack 0x400 correctly when
  the reader is suspended (e.g. libusb only detects the reader when it
  currently is not suspended, but the reader needs some time to become
  active after resuming and Libusb does not wait for this time...
  Now we just try for about 5 secs to enumerate the USB devices via libusb
  which keeps the reader active until it has completed its initialization).
  This fix is only needed as long as Libusb has these problems, maybe they
  will fix this...


===========================================================================
MARK: released ctapi-cyberjack-3.0.0 (2007/06/22)
===========================================================================


2007/06/22: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
------------------------------------------------
- addes some necessary files for Debian
- introduce check for SuSE10.x: Apparently those systems do not like the call
  to "getenv()" we use in USBLinux.cpp. On all SuSE10 systems this makes
  the driver crash. So for now this call is just disabled on affected systems.
- fixed Info.plist


2007/06/21: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
------------------------------------------------
- fixed usbdropdir for RPM packages
- added diagnosis tool "cyberjack"
- prepared release of version 3.0.0 (Linux)


2007/06/06: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
------------------------------------------------
- changed Debug.cpp again: Really, we cannot include ctapi_config_l.h due to 
  circular dependencies (the CTAPI stuff is a layer above the code in 
  Debug.cpp). Since the MAC people seem to insist on including it anyway
  (since they reverted my latest modification in that field) I wrapped an
  #ifdef around that include


2007/05/12: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
------------------------------------------------
- changed Debug.cpp: Cannot include ctapi_config_l.h due to circular
  dependencies (the CTAPI stuff is a layer above the code in Debug.cpp,
  so we can't use it here). It was used for setting the initial debug layer
  anyway, and this can also be achieved by using the method 
  CDebug::setLevelMask()
- latest changes introduced SCARD_CTL_CODE which wasn't previously 
  available to the Linux code (we don't include PC/SC stuff to stay independent
  from it)
- added definition for type SCARD_IO_REQUEST (same reason)
- what the heck is this newly introduced "#pragma message"???


===========================================================================
MARK: released ctapi-cyberjack-3.0.0beta1 (2007/05/08)
===========================================================================


2007/05/07: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
------------------------------------------------
- added driver for pinpad_a (heavily adapted it to enable it to work with
  the new USB framework)
- renamed files with suffix "2" back to names without this suffix since this
  driver will succeed the old driver
- use version from configure.ac instead of Windows code version (we still use
  that in log messages)
- adapted files for PC/SC to now additionally support older readers
- set version to 3.0.0beta1 (for first beta release)
- ausb_l.h: added missing include


2007/05/04: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
------------------------------------------------
- added envrionment variable "CJ_USB_MODE" which can be used with the
  tool cjflash to force the USB implementation to be used (because they
  differ very much and at least the flash tool needs to be able to work
  with old firmware)
- added section to README.xml and LIESMICH.xml about flashing the cyberjack
  ecom_a
- changed prototype for CTAPI key callback handler (now also has a  key value
  as an argument)
- added driver for old ECOM


2007/05/02: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
------------------------------------------------
- added IFD handler from old Cyberjack driver and adapted it to
  this new driver
- moved filenames in order to allow this driver to be installed in parallel
  with the old driver (as long as the new driver doesn't support the older
  readers)
- added basic packaging files (RPM, DEB)
- added documentation (basically copied over from old driver)
- added tool cjgeldkarte2 (basically copied over from old driver)
- prepared first beta release


2007/04/30: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
------------------------------------------------
- halt interrupt pipe upon USBLinux::Open()
- now always uses USB implementation 3 for 0x400er devices
- fixed incompatibilities introduced by SVN merge


2007/04/27: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
------------------------------------------------
- added tool for flashing the reader under Linux
- added yet another approach to the USB interface
- completed CTAPI driver for Linux
- now only exports CTAPI functions and class CReader
- modified ausb module: Now the Linux implementation
  can choose between 3 different implementation. This is
  needed to allow the flash tool to work with any firmware so
  we can now flash any Ecom A regardless of the firmware
  version
- configure.ac: Now checks whether thread-support is requested,
  only compile thread-related modules in case it is


2007/04/26: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
------------------------------------------------
- improved logging for Linux (new log file format allows
  for better filtering, so users may now send full logs
  and I will still be able to filter out the important
  parts)
- implemented CTAPI driver
- added a CTAPI test tool
- tried a thread-based approach to the interrupt pipe problem
- beeping now works with X11 also!


2007/04/25: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
------------------------------------------------
- Debug.{h,cpp}: 
  - implemented code for Linux
  - added DEBUG_MASK_CTAPI
  - added DEBUG_MASK_IFD
  - added function rsct_debug_out() to allow for debugging
    output from C (previously it only worked with C++)
  - added method setLevelMask() to allow for runtime modification of
    the level mask (on Linux)
  - added method setLogFileName() to allow for runtime modification 
    of the logfile (on Linux)
  - fixed definition of DEBUG_MASK_IFD
- only use #pragma(warning) on Windows (gets rid of warnings under Linux)
- added ausb/ (lowlevel asynchronous communication via USB on Linux)
- implemented USBLinux.cpp (now COM via USB works on Linux)
- started working on CTAPI
